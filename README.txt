NOTE:
-----
alms.py is for Automating Reading Materials, PDFs, PPTs & DOCs
alms2.py is for Automating Discussion forum
You should run both; one after the other

These is no automation avaiable for "Assignments" or "Quiz" as of now.
You have to do it manually. (But at least I automated 85% of your work!)
